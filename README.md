# Mathematica Notebooks

1) SchwarzChristoffelMapping_CGWalk.nb : This Mathematica notebook calculates conformal map using Schwarz-Christoffel
   mapping to create two dimensional chemical and electrostiatic potential field from one dimensional solution.The solution
   of chemical field was taken from Bazant et al 2004. We used similar solution to perform programmable motion of 
   microscopic particles (Sharma et al, 2015).
